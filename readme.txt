This is a binding tool set, which is still being improved. I would like to ask you to help me test it. If there are bugs and functions you want to add, please contact me. Although it is said that the current capacity is limited and you may not be able to modify them quickly, the modified ones will be added again in the future. Thank you for your willingness to use this tool set.

How to use: copy the entire folder of muzitoolset to the scripts under the Maya installation path, and run the start script file in the startup folder in Maya.

The modules that have been written include controller, adsorption, renaming and node creation

The logic of object selection is to select one or more source target models and select the target to be realized to realize the corresponding function
---------Controller module---------
Upper part: select the controller you want to transform for the set controller shape. Double click the shape to quickly transform.
At the same time, you can right-click in the blank to upload your favorite controller shape and delete the corresponding controller shape.
Middle part: for the set controller color, select the controller you want to change the color. Double click the color to quickly change it.
The following part:
1. Zoom: select the controller you want to zoom, press B to soft select and adjust the size of the controller you want, and then click zoom.
2. Mirror: select the controller that needs to be mirrored, and then select the controller mirror as the reference mirror. However, at present, the mirror function is only based on the world coordinates, and the mirror mode will be further improved in the future
3. Replacement: select the controller to be replaced, and then select the controller to be replaced as the reference replacement
---------Adsorption module---------
Three adsorption methods:
1. Position + rotation: adsorption displacement and rotation
2. Position: only adsorption displacement
3. Rotation only absorbs rotation
Logic of adsorbed object: select the vertex or CV component of the adsorbed surface, then select the object or component to be adsorbed, and click adsorption.
---------Rename---------
Change the name according to the corresponding input box
---------Nodes: Creating---------
Generate corresponding nodes according to the preset number and name of nodes.
